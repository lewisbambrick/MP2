Mockup

## About the Game.

    "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" is an amazing variation on the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game. Originally created on a show called The Big Bang Theory, it adds in an extra two variables to spice the game up. Those who are nerdy enough will recognise the variables straight away from star trek.
    The game can be accessed by use of a URL and allows you to play against the computer in a game of chance to try and beat the Computer.

## Planning
### (UX) User Experience

#### User stories

##### First Time Visitor Goals
    As a First time visitor :
    1. I want to instantly understand what the purpose of the site is.
    2. I want to be able to understand the game and how the controls work with ease, but if need be to have extra help, with rules,etc..
    3. I want to be able to keep track of my score at all times so I can see if I am in the lead or the computer is.
    5. I want the game to be very simple yet fun.

    Due to the fact that there is no option to log in or add any personal details to the site, every user is treated as a First time visitor.

#### Owner Goals

    As the sites Owner :
    1. I want to provide a simple interactive game on the internet.
    2. I want the game to be free and for users to have nothing like that to worry about on my site.
    3. I want the game to be able to provide plenty of entertainment to all users who use it.  

#### Structure:
    This website is made to be smooth, clear and easy to navigate. It is adapted for all types of devices so that it will always be smooth and user-friendly. The User will be very satisfied with the interaction and simplicity that the game provides.

        *Game area Colour : #9e9e9e

## Features of my site
    The website I have creeated, consistes of a single page. This page contains a game of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.
The Features of my site are:
### Header
    The Header of my site is simple and attractive. It is a H1 that is just the title of the game. The header is eye catching but doesnt take away from the game.

### Game Area
    The Game area is a box that has a lighter colour than the background of the site. This makes it pop out to the user.

### Controls
    The game controls are contained within the game area.They are Font awesome icons that represent the hand signals for the game choices in real life.The have a hover style Which pops a red border circle around them.This leaves no doubt as to which selector you are over.

### Score Area
    The scoring area is located just beneath the game area. The scoring area consists of the Users score and the computers score.The font colour for this area was chosen to be a lighter colour to be in contrast to the background.

### Rules area
    The rules area Which I actually think is really cool is a modal feature. This means that it is normally hidden except from when the user clicks the "Rules" button located just beneath the scoring area.
    Once clicked the user gets a pop up on the screen that contains a heading that says "Rules" And an image that contains all the user needs to know about the game.While the pop up is active it overlays a shade over the background so the user can focus on the rules area with ease.It has a close button on it, however it also has a feature that will close the pop up if you click anywhere outside of it.

## Testing

### Compatibility testing
    I tested my site on multiple devices and browsers. I did this by using the Chrome development tools on my Chrome book.
    My site was also tested on my Chromebook, an iPhone 5 and a Google Pixel 4a.

### Functionality testing
    For the duration of my project I used my Chrome developer tools to keep testing with styles and responsiveness.

### User story testing
    As a First time visitor :
    1. I want to instantly understand what the purpose of the site is.
        >The site doesn't have a wall of text, instead it has the universal simbols for the selectors for the game in the form of icons. This tells the user instantly what to do.
        >The header of the site is the name of the game, and its in big bold letters so it cant be missed.   

    2. I want to be able to understand the game and how the controls work with ease, but if need be to have extra help, with rules,etc..
        >The controls for the game is as simple as just clicking an icon and you either win or lose the round, yes, that simple.
        >The game provides rules which are in an extremely easy to understand image, rather than confusing text.

    3. I want to be able to keep track of my score at all times so I can see if I am in the lead or the computer is.
        >The site has a really simple scoring are that makes keeping track of your score simple and sweet.
    5. I want the game to be very simple yet fun.
        >The game is as simple as just clicking a button, theres nothing more to it.It is fun trying to stay ahead of the computer, and if youre competitive enough you could chance your arm as long as you want.

### Owner Goals testing

        >People can keep playing as long as they want and if competitive enough ccan battle the computer at a game of chance as long as they want.

## Issues and fixes
    My main issue with this project was just my own lack of grasping JavaScript.This resulted in me having to completely restart my project multiple times
        > This was helped by the amazing students on the slack community, thay have been extremely helpful and pointed me in the right direction whenever i needed it. 

### Code Validation
    At the end of my project, I Validated both my CSS code and my HTML code using:
 -  [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS.
 - [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML.

### Performance Test
    To test the performance of my site I used the Google developer tool, Lighthouse.

##  Deployment

The project was deployed on GitHub Pages. I used Gitpod as a development environment where I commited all changes to git version control system.
I used the push command in Gitpod to save changes into GitHub.

To run locally:
* Log in to GitHub and click on repository to download ([MP2](https://github.com/lewisbambrick/MP2)).
* Select "Code" and click Download the ZIP file.
* After downloading the file you can extract the file and use it in your local environment.

To deploy the project I had to:

* Log in to GitHub and click on repository to deploy ([MP2](https://github.com/lewisbambrick/MP2))
* Select "Settings" and find the "GitHub Pages" section at the very bottom of the page.
* From source select "none" and then "master branch".
* Click "save" and the page was deployed after auto-refresh.
*  My site was published at https://lewisbambrick.github.io/MP2/

# Credits
* For this project I used the Code Institute student Template [gitpod full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
* ### Ideas
    - Many of the resources I reviewed from the Code Institute, such as the Love Math practice project, served as inspiration for this project. Iused this practice project to help me decide on a layout.
* ### Controls
    - the icons that I used for the controls were taken from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
* ### Image
    - The image I used for the rules section of site was given to me by a fellow student.
* ### Code
    - Overall I had alot of help from fellow students with their experience with JavaScript. The have helped me decide what to use and have told me what wouldnt work.
    - Modal code for rules pop up were learned from 
    [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) located on Youtube.
