## About the Game.

"Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" is an amazing variation on the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game. Originally created on a show called The Big Bang Theory, it adds in an extra two variables to spice the game up. Those who are nerdy enough will recognise the variables straight away from star trek.
The game can be accessed by use of a URL and allows you to play against the computer in a game of chance to try and beat the Computer.
